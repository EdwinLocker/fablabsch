name: SDG Solution Space
description: The University of Geneva (UNIGE) is running the Geneva SDG Solution Space,
  a true workshop where students, researchers, humanitarian workers and UN experts
  will gather to provide practical answers to the challenges of sustainable development.
  The focus will be on the 17 SDGs — Sustainable Development Goals — set by the United
  Nations in 2015. This new 300 m2 facility opened its doors on Friday 12th of May,
  on the occasion of the third Open Geneva Hackathon which brings innovation to the
  heart of the city. It is housed in the Biotech Innovation Park Campus in Sécheron,
  in the centre of International Geneva. Users will enjoy state-of-the-art digital
  technology (such as 3D printers and laser cutters) to help them develop prototypes,
  validate projects and, more broadly, test the suitability of their ideas.
